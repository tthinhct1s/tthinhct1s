## 🚀 About Me

I am a motivated and fast-learning engineering student with a strong interest in **embedded systems and embedded testing**, especially in **automotive applications**.  
I enjoy working close to hardware, setting up test environments, debugging embedded systems, and understanding how software interacts with real devices.

I am currently seeking an **Embedded Test / Embedded Software Internship**, where I can gain hands-on experience in **ECU testing, laboratory work, and validation processes**, while building a solid testing and quality mindset.  
In the long term, I am also interested in **intelligent and AI-enabled embedded systems (AIoT / Edge AI)**.
